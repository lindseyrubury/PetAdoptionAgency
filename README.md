## Problem Description:
This database supports the organization of a sample Pet Adoption System. It covers many Pet Adoption operations including Adopting, Fostering, Pet Care, Adoption Center Supply Management, Adoption Events, Employee Supervision etc. Queries can be conducted on this database to provide managerial insight on process operations. Furthermore, through this project, we would like to perform queries on the data model in order to prove why Managers would care about this database, and how they can utilize it to improve their operational efficiency.

Q1 Managerial Perspective: This query generates a summary of pets with health issues across various shelters. It provides the shelter name, the count of pets that are classified as unhealthy, their current health status, and their adoption status. This information can be used to monitor shelters with a higher concentration of pets that require medical attention, potentially identifying shelters that may need additional resources or support. Additionally, the adoption status data helps track the outcomes for pets with health issues, offering insights into how effectively shelters are managing the adoption process for animals with medical concerns.


Query 2: Find Pets and Their Foster Records that occured during 2024. This query finds pets and their foster records for those who were fostered between specific dates.

Q2 Managerial Perspective: This query identifies pets and their foster records from 2024, focusing on those placed in foster care within specific start and end dates. By tracking the duration and number of foster placements for each pet, management can monitor foster program activity and assess how effectively pets are being matched with foster families. This data helps identify pets with extended foster stays or multiple placements, which may signal a need for additional resources or better matching strategies. It also supports more efficient resource allocation, ensuring pets and foster families receive the appropriate level of support. Ultimately, these insights can guide improvements in the foster care process and help increase adoption rates.


Query 3: Find out which shelters have administered the highest number of different medications to their pets.

Q3 Managerial Perspective: This query identifies shelters that have administered the highest number of different medications to their pets. It focuses on the distribution of medications across shelters, giving insight into which shelters may have more complex or varied medical needs among their animal populations. The results can help shelter managers understand where the heaviest medical intervention is occurring and may highlight shelters that require additional medical supplies, support, or funding. This information is essential for resource allocation and ensuring that shelters can continue to provide the necessary care for their animals.


Query 4: This query calculates the average age of pets adopted from each shelter.

Q4 Managerial Perspective: This query calculates the average age of pets adopted from each shelter, providing insight into adoption trends related to pet age. Shelters can use this information to understand whether younger or older pets are more frequently adopted, which can inform strategies for promoting the adoption of different age groups. Knowing the average age of adopted pets may also help shelters tailor their care and outreach efforts, ensuring they meet the needs of both younger and older pets to improve overall adoption rates. This data is valuable for making informed decisions on how to market pets for adoption.


Query 5: This query shows the most common pet breeds across all shelters, grouped by breed and ordered by the number of adoptions in descending order.
